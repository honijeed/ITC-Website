    <h1>PORTFOLIO #2</h1>
    <h3 id = "subtitle">Data, Information, <br>and Information Systems</h3>

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide1"> Data and Information </h3>

    <p class = para id = para1>Data is a collection of raw facts, figures, observations, and details that can be processed to extract meaningful information. It exists in various forms, such as symbols, descriptions, events, entities, and variables. 

        Information is the processed, organized, and structured representation of data. It provides context and meaning to raw data, making it useful for decision-making.
        Key Differences between Data and Information:
        
        <br><br>-Raw vs. Processed: Data is raw and unprocessed, while information is processed and organized.
        <br><br>-Variables vs. Meaning: Data consists of variables, while information represents a specific event, idea, or condition.
        <br><br>-Purpose vs. Explanation: Data doesn't necessarily have a clear purpose at the time of collection, while information provides a relevant explanation.
        <br><br>-Interdependence: Information is dependent on data, but data is not dependent on information.
        <br><br>Decision-Making: Data alone is not sufficient for decision-making, while information can support it.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide2"> Information Systems </h3>
    
    <p class = para id = para2>Information system, an integrated set of components for collecting, 
        storing, and processing data and for providing information, knowledge, and digital products. 
        Business firms and other organizations rely on information systems to carry out and manage 
        their operations, interact with their customers and suppliers, and compete in the marketplace.
        Information systems are used to run interorganizational supply chains and electronic markets. 
        For instance, corporations use information systems to process financial accounts, to manage
        their human resources, and to reach their potential customers with online promotions.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide3"> Different Types of Support Systems in <br>Information Systems</h3>

    <p class = para id = para3>
        <br><br>-Transaction Processing Systems (TPS): These systems handle day-to-day business operations like order processing, payments, and inventory management.

        <br><br>-Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): ERP systems integrate all business functions into a single system, providing a centralized database for various tasks.

        <br><br>-Business Collaboration Systems: These systems improve communication and collaboration among employees, especially important for remote work.

        <br><br>-Management Information Systems (MIS): MIS collects and processes operational data to provide managers with information for decision-making.

        <br><br>-Decision Support Systems (DSS): DSS helps managers make complex decisions by providing analytical tools and insights.

        <br><br>-Customer Relationship Management (CRM): CRM systems manage customer interactions and relationships, providing a platform for data analysis and customer experience improvement.
