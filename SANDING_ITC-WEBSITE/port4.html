    <h3 id = subtitle>Computer Hardware and Software: <br>Their Implementation in the <br> different institutions in the community</h3>
    
    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide1>Computer System</h3>

    <p class = para id = para1>
        Computer System is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, 
and store data and information. It is built around at least one digital 
processing device. Computer Systems can be viewed as consisting of 3 
main components: Hardware, Data, and Software 

<br><br>There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, 
Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.
    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide2>Hardware</h3>

    <p class = para id = para2>
        It is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of a 
digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of 
a computing device from software, which consists of written instructions 
that tell physical components what to do. 
These physical components refer to the computer parts, such as, monitor, 
keyboard, hard drive disk, mouse, printers, graphic cards, sound cards, 
memory, motherboard and chips, etc all of which are physical objects that 
you can actually touch. 
Computer hardware can be categorized as being either internal or external 
components. Generally, internal hardware components are those necessary 
for the proper functioning of the computer, while external hardware 
components are attached to the computer to add or enhance functionality. <br><br>

Hardware Basic Data Flow<br>
-Input
to provide or give something to the computer 
Input

<br><br>-Processing
the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads

<br><br>-Output
data generated by a computer is referred to as output

    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide3>Hardware Components</h3>

    <p class = para id = para3>
        These internal components collectively process or store the instructions 
        delivered by the program or operating system: <br><br>
        
        Motherboard <br>
        CPU (Computer Processing Unit) <br>
        RAM (Random Access Memory) <br>
        Hard Drive <br>
        SSD (Solid -state Drive) <br>
        Optical Drive <br>
        Heat Sink <br>
        GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) <br>
        NIC (Network Interface Card)<br>

        <br><br>
        External hardware components or peripheral components, are items that 
are often externally connected to the computer to control either input or 
output functions: <br><br>

Mouse <br>
Keyboard <br>
Microphone <br>
Camera <br>
Touchpad <br>
USB Flash Drive <br>
Memory Card<br>
    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide4>Software</h3>

    <p class = para id = para4>
        Software consists of computer programs that 
instruct the execution of a computer. It is a set of 
programs, procedures, algorithms and its 
documentation concerned with the operation of a 
data processing system. Software also includes 
design documents and specifications.<br><br>

Application Software<br>
Computer programs for performing user tasks, 
such as word processing and web browsers. These 
are programs that are of actual value to the user. 
General-Purpose Application Software performs 
common information processing jobs for the end- 
user. 
Application Specific Software is designed to 
accomplish a specific task. It tends to be more 
inflexible in purpose, but performs more efficiently 
on certain purposes they are made to do.<br><br>

System Software<br>
System Software is used to either create, run, 
manage, or support the operation of the computer 
system. <br>
System Management Software runs, manage, 
and/or support computer hardware networking, 
application software, execution, and data 
resources. <br>
System Development Software consists of 
programming languages (procedural, functional, 
object-oriented, scripting, and logic), and levels of 
programming languages (low level: first and 
second generation; high level: third, fourth, and 
fifth generation)

    <p class = para id = para5>
        EDUCATION<br>
        Hardware provides the physical infrastructure necessary 
for digital learning, such as: computers and laptops, 
tablets and smartphones, interactive whiteboards, 
projectors, cameras, 3D printers, and robotics kits 
Software provides the digital tools and applications that 
run on hardware, such as: LMS, educational software, 
productivity tools, communication tools, educational 
games and simulations, digital libraries and databases. 
Benefits are personalized learning, enhanced 
engagement, improved collaboration, access to 
information, development of digital skills, and 
accessibility<br><br>

        HEALTHCARE<br>
        Hardware provides the physical machines to be used in 
healthcare, such as: computers, tablets, health monitors, 
BP cuffs, glucose meters, X-ray machines, CT scanners, 
MRI machines, ultrasounds. 
Software provides digital tools and systems that allows 
healthcare workers to store, manage, and share health 
information efficiently. 
Benefits are improved patient care, increased efficiency, 
enhanced patient engagement, and advanced research.<br><br>

        BUSINESS<br>
        Both hardware and software play a crucial role in the 
business community, it helps with operational efficiency, 
such as ERP systems, automation tools, cloud computing. 
In customer relationship management, it helps with CRM 
software and CRM systems. In E-commerce and online 
sales, it helps with e-commerce platforms, payment 
giveaways, and inventory management software. 
In marketing and sales, it helps with marketing 
automation tools, CRM systems, and salesforce. In human 
resources, it helps with HRIS and LMS. Lastly, in 
cybersecurity, it helps with firewalls, antivirus software, 
and encryption software.
        <br><br>

        GOVERNMENT<br>
        Both hardware and software play a crucial role in the 
government, where it helps in e-governance in terms of 
citizen services, e-procurement, and e-participation. In 
public safety and security, it helps in surveillance 
systems, emergency response systems, and 
cybersecurity. Lastly, in infrastructure management, it 
helps in geographic information systems and building 
management systems. 
Benefits are increased efficiency, improved transparency, 
enhanced citizen services, data-driven decision making, 
and cost reduction.<br><br>
