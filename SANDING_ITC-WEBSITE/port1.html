    <h3 id = subtitle>Computer Science as Discipline,<br>Computing Disciplines and Majors</h3>

    <h3 class="slidehead" id = slide1> Computer Science as a Discipline </h3>
    
    <p class = para id = "para1">
        Computer Science is a discipline that is firmly centered on computing theory,
        abstraction, and design. It encompasses much more than just programming
        and delves into various areas such as hardware design, system architecture,  
        and database applications. Computer Science is a discipline that focuses on 
        computing theory, abstraction, and design, encompassing areas such as
        hardware design, system architecture, and database applications.
        <br><br>
        The field of computer science can be broadly divided into two categories:
        applications and systems. Applications deal with tasks involving the 
        processing of information, which can be numerical, utilizing
        mathematics, or non-numerical, involving symbols. On the other
        hand, systems focus on the structures and mechanisms that enable 
        information processing.

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide2">
        Computer Engineering as a Discipline
    </h3>

    <p class = para id = "para2">
        Computer engineering is solidly grounded in the theories and principles of
        computing, mathematics, science, and engineering and it applies these 
        theories and principles to solve technical problems through the design of
        computing hardware, software, networks, and processes. Historically, the
        field of computer engineering has been widely viewed as "designing 
        computers." In reality, the design of computers themselves has been the 
        province of relatively few highly skilled engineers whose goal was to push 
        forward the limits of computer and microelectronics technology.
        These applications manifest themselves in the proliferation of mobile 
        telephones, personal digital assistants, location-aware devices, digital 
        cameras, and similar products.

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide3">
        Information Systems as a Discipline
    </h3>

    <p class = para id = "para3">
        Information systems is an academic discipline of the complementary 
        networks of hardware, software, users and business processes that
        organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data. 
        Any specific information system aims to support planning, operations, 
        management and decision making.<br><br>

        Contemporary approaches to understanding the domain of Information 
        Systems interfaces a multi-disciplinary perspective. Essentially, in this 
        lens, the usage of information technology is viewed through the lens of 
        people, process and technology. 
    </p>

    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide4">
        Information Technology as a Discipline
    </h3>

    <p class = para id = "para4">
        Information technology is a label that has two meanings. In the broadest 
        sense, the term information technology is often used to refer to all of 
        computing. IT is a rapidly growing field that started as a grassroots 
        response to the practical, everyday needs of business and other 
        organizations. Today, organizations of every kind are dependent on 
        information technology. They need to have appropriate systems in 
        place. These systems must work properly, be secure, and upgraded, 
        maintained, and replaced as appropriate. Employees throughout an 
        organization require support from IT staff who understand computer
        systems and their software and are committed to solving whatever 
        computer-related problems they might have. Graduates of information
        technology programs address these needs.
    </p>

    
        
    <h3 class = "slidehead" id = "slide5">
        Software Engineering as a Discipline
    </h3>

    <p class = para id = "para5">
        Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, 
        and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to 
        software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and
        maintainable software. Software engineering emerged in the late 1960s 
        as a new engineering discipline concerned with all aspects pertaining 
        to software production. It encompasses concepts, principles, theories, 
        techniques and tools that can be used for developing high-quality professional software.
