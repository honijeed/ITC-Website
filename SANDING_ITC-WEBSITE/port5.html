    <h3 id = subtitle>Comparative Study On <br>Different Types Of Motherboards</h3>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide1>INTRODUCTION</h3>

    <p class = para id = para1>
        The IBM Personal Computer (1981) featured the first motherboard as we know it. At first, this component was called a planar, and at the beginning of its creation, went through several additional names until it was finally called the motherboard. This was the first time in computer history that a board housed the computer’s CPU and RAM, and provided audio as well as many other functions. This board also supplied ports for the keyboard and cassette tape and had expansion slots for add-on cards. There was even a system known as the bus to manage the information flow here. It was a revolutionary machine that changed the future of computing.

        What is a motherboard?
    </h3>

    <p class = para id = para2>
        It is the main circuit board in a computer system. It connects all of the internal components, like the memory, processor, graphics card and other hardware. It also provides power to each component and allows them to communicate with each other. The motherboard is a key part of any computer, and its importance cannot be overstated. With out the motherboard there would be no computer.
