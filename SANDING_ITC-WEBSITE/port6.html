    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide1>What is a Computer?</h3>

    <p class = para id = para1>
        A computer is an electronic device that
        manipulates information or data. It has
        the ability to store, retrieve, and process
        data. There are many types of computer:
        Supercomputer, Mainframe Computers,
        Mini Computers, Server, Workstations,
        and Micro Computers.

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide2>Types of Computers</h3>

    <p class = para id = para2>
        SUPERCOMPUTER<br>
        They are the biggest and fastest computers and are designed to process a huge amount of data.

It is used in scientific and engineering
applications, such as: weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research.

<br><br>MAINFRAME COMPUTER<br>
They are designed to support hundreds
or thousands of users at the same time. It
can also support multiple programs
simultaneously.
Mainframe Computer
agenda 1
It is used in big organizations, like
banking, telecom sectors, etc., which
process a high volume of data in general.

<br><br>MINI COMPUTER<br>
It is a computer that is smaller, less expensive, less powerful than a supercomputer or a mainframe  computer, but more expensive and powerful than a personal computer. 

It is used in places like institutes or
departments for different work (billing,
accounting, inventory management, etc.)

<br><br>SERVER<br>
It is a computer program or device that
provides a service to another computer program and its user. It is used to share data as well to share resources and distribute work.

<br><br>WORKSTATIONS<br>
It is a high-performance computer system that is basically designed for a single user and has advanced graphic capabilities, large storage capacity, and a powerful CPU. It is used in data science, 3D design, video editing, and engineering.

<br><br>MICRO COMPUTERS<br>
Primarily called personal computer, is a complete computer on a small scale, designed for use by one person at a time. It is used in data and word processing, electronic spreadsheets, professional presentation and graphics programs, communications and databases management systems.
