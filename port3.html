    <h3 id = subtitle>Number Systems</h3>
    
    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide1>What are Number Systems?</h3>

    <p class = para id = para1>
        Number systems are methods of representing numbers using symbols. They are essential for counting, measuring, and performing mathematical operations.
Key components of a number system include:

<br><br>Base: The number of distinct symbols used to represent numbers. For example, the decimal system (our most common system) has a base of 10, using the symbols 0-9.
<br><br>Place value: The position of a digit in a number determines its value. In the decimal system, the place value increases by a factor of 10 from right to left.

<br><br>Common number systems include:
<br>Decimal (base 10): Uses the digits 0-9.
<br>Binary (base 2): Uses the digits 0 and 1.
<br>Hexadecimal (base 16): Uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F.
<br>Octal (base 8): Uses the digits 0-7.
    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide2>Types of Number Systems:<br>Decimal</h3>

    <p class = para id = para2>
        The decimal number system, also known as the base-10 system, is the most commonly used number system

        <br><br>in everyday life. It uses ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) to represent numbers. 

        Key Characteristics of the Decimal System:
        <br><br>-Base 10: As the name implies, the base of this system is 10. This means that the value of a digit in a number depends on its position.
        <br><br>-Place Value: The position of a digit in a number determines its value. For instance, in the number 123, the 1 is in the hundreds place, the 2 is in the tens place, and the 3 is in the ones place.
        <br><br>-Grouping: Numbers are grouped in sets of ten. For example, 10 ones equal 1 ten, 10 tens equal 1 hundred, and so on.
    </p>


    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide3>Types of Number Systems:<br>Binary</h3>

    <p class = para id = para3> 
        The binary number system is a base-2 system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. This simplicity makes it well-suited for digital computers, which operate on electrical signals that can be either on (represented by 1) or off (represented by 0).

<br><br>Key Characteristics of the Binary System:
<br>-Base 2: The base of the binary system is 2.
<br><br>-Place Value: Similar to the decimal system, the position of a digit in a binary number determines its value. However, the place values in the binary system increase by powers of 2.
<br><br>-Grouping: Numbers are grouped in sets of two. For example, 2 ones equal 1 two, 2 twos equal 1 four, and so on.

    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide4>Types of Number Systems:<br>Octal</h3>

    <p class = para id = para4>
        The octal number system is a base-8 system that uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It is sometimes used in computer science for representing binary numbers in a more compact form.
        <br><br>Key Characteristics of the Octal System:

<br>-Base 8: The base of the octal system is 8.
<br><br>-Place Value: Similar to the decimal and binary systems, the position of a digit in an octal number determines its value. However, the place values in the octal system increase by powers of 8.
<br><br>-Grouping: Numbers are grouped in sets of eight. For example, 8 ones equal 1 eight, 8 eights equal 1 sixty-four, and so on.
    </p>

    <h3 class = slidehead id = slide5>Types of Number Systems:<br>Hexadecimal</h3>

    <p class = para id = para5>
        The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system that uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent numbers. It's commonly used in computer science for representing binary data in a more compact and readable form.
<br><br>Key Characteristics of the Hexadecimal System:
<br>-Base 16: The base of the hexadecimal system is 16.
<br><br>-Place Value: Similar to other number systems, the position of a digit in a hexadecimal number determines its value. However, the place values in the hexadecimal system increase by powers of 16.
<br><br>-Grouping: Numbers are grouped in sets of sixteen. For example, 16 ones equal 1 sixteen, 16 sixteens equal 1 two-fifty-six, and so on.
